    <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
    <p>
      I am passionate about developing ethical, explainable, and user-centered AI solutions that bridge technology and human impact. My academic work at Indiana Wesleyan University focuses on responsible AI, data analytics, and cloud integration using AWS and Python. I aim to apply advanced machine learning methods to solve real-world challenges in decision-making, automation, and predictive analytics.

    <h2>Artifact 1: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      This presentation explores the historical evolution of Artificial Intelligence, tracing its journey from early symbolic systems to modern deep learning and generative models. It highlights key milestones such as Turing’s foundational test, the Dartmouth Conference, and the emergence of neural networks. 
      The artifact also addresses challenges faced during the AI winters and emphasizes the leadership lessons drawn from technological growth, resilience, and ethical innovation. 
      The goal was to understand how AI has evolved into a transformative technology shaping industries and human interactions today.

    <h2>Artifact 2: AI Lab – Chatbot Assistant Prototype</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact demonstrates my practical application of natural language processing and AI model integration. 
      I built a chatbot prototype capable of responding to user queries using structured prompts and context-driven conversation flows. 
      The focus was on building an ethical AI assistant that could maintain user trust through responsible data handling and clear interaction logic. 
      This project strengthened my technical understanding of Python, machine learning workflows, and API-based integration, reflecting my commitment to building explainable and reliable AI systems.
