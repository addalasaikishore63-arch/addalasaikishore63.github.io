    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am passionate about developing ethical, explainable, and user-centered AI solutions that bridge technology and human impact.
      Currently pursuing my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Indiana Wesleyan University, my focus is on combining
      data-driven insights with responsible AI principles to create intelligent systems that promote innovation, efficiency, and fairness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests include Responsible AI, data analytics, cloud integration (AWS/Python), and AI-driven software engineering with
      Java/Spring Boot. I aim to leverage my technical and analytical strengths to design AI applications that not only deliver
      performance but also align with ethical and social responsibility standards.

    <h2>Artifact 1 – The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact explores the evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), tracing its journey from early symbolic systems to modern
      deep learning and generative models. The objective is to understand AI’s progression and highlight key milestones that shaped its
      transformation into today’s intelligent systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work discusses foundational concepts such as Alan Turing’s 1950 test of machine intelligence and the 1956 Dartmouth Conference
      that marked the birth of AI as an academic field. It further analyzes the “AI Winters,” when funding and progress slowed, and the
      breakthroughs that reignited AI research in the 2000s through machine learning and data-driven methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, neural networks and deep learning have revolutionized AI, allowing it to excel in fields like computer vision,
      natural language processing, and generative AI. The emergence of large-scale models demonstrates both AI’s potential and the
      ethical responsibility that comes with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exploration emphasizes how leadership and innovation have continuously shaped AI—from theoretical curiosity to a powerful
      tool transforming industries today.
